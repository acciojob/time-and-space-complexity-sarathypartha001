	<h1>Time and space complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the measure of how an algorithm's runtime scales with input size, often expressed using Big-O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case scenario.</p>
	<p><b> Space Complexity </b>of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input.</p>
